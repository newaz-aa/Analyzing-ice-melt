Image Processing Task

In this project, satellite images are used to study climate change.  Two images of the same region in Antarctica taken two years apart were analyzed. The first image was captured in January of 2018 and the second image was taken in January of 2020. The objective is to understand how much more water from melting is visible in the image taken two years after the first. 

The project is done using Matlab 2020a. Color thresholder app is utilized for experimentation.
